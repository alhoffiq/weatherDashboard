# How to use

Search for a city you would like to see the weather forcast for by either typing it in the search bar or clicking one of the buttons with the city names. The buttons are updated everytime you search for a new city to show the previous 4 cities you have searched for and will remain after a refresh.

The page will automatically load the last city you have searched for when you come back to it later.
